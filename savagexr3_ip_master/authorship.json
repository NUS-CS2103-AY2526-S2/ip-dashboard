Rather than using AI to replace my thinking, I used it as a support tool to guide decisions, refine ideas, and improve efficiency. This experience changed how I view AI — not as a shortcut, but as a collaborator that still requires critical evaluation.","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-19T12:06:53","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":4,"author":{"gitId":"savagexr3"},"content":"1. ### Learning JavaFX UI Through AI Guidance","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-19T12:06:53","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":5,"author":{"gitId":"savagexr3"},"content":"   One of my biggest challenges was working with JavaFX UI. I did not have prior experience with JavaFX, and my initial instinct was to approach it similarly to HTML and CSS. However, I quickly realized that JavaFX does not provide tools like “inspect element,” which made layout debugging more difficult.","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-19T12:06:53","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":6,"author":{"gitId":"savagexr3"},"content":"   I used AI to better understand how JavaFX layouts work, especially when trying to place the send button inside the rectangular text input box. While AI did not always give a perfect solution immediately, iterative prompting helped refine the implementation. Through this process, I learned more about JavaFX layout structures rather than blindly copying code.","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-19T12:06:53","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":7,"author":{"gitId":"savagexr3"},"content":"   This experience taught me that AI is most effective when used interactively — providing context, testing the solution, and refining it step by step.","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-19T12:06:53","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":8,"author":{"gitId":"savagexr3"},"content":"2. ### Documentation and Code Clarity","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-19T12:06:53","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":9,"author":{"gitId":"savagexr3"},"content":"   For JavaDoc documentation, I used AI to generate method and class comments.

This required me to review, edit, and sometimes rewrite parts of the documentation. Through this, I realized that documentation is not just about filling space — it requires clarity and accuracy, especially when explaining design intent.","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-19T12:06:53","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":11,"author":{"gitId":"savagexr3"},"content":"   AI made the process faster, but I was still responsible for ensuring correctness and quality.","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-19T12:06:53","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":12,"author":{"gitId":"savagexr3"},"content":"3. ### Understanding Software Architecture and Separation of Concerns","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-19T12:06:53","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":13,"author":{"gitId":"savagexr3"},"content":"   AI also played a role in helping me think about project structure and code organization. For example, when implementing the FreeCommand, I questioned whether its logic should be placed inside TaskList. AI explained why that would violate separation of concerns, since TaskList should only manage tasks rather than handle command logic.","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-19T12:06:53","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":14,"author":{"gitId":"savagexr3"},"content":"   This reinforced architectural principles that I learned in class.

Based on AI’s suggestion, I switched to JavaFX’s MediaPlayer. Although AI suggested the alternative, I still had to understand the lifecycle and usage of the media player to implement it correctly.
