In other cases, it is still safe as I still will look at these suggestions and decide whether they are valid, or whether there is extra context and nuance that the reviewer may have missed. I can either reference directly in a new issue to keep track of it, or sometimes spawn a Copilot session to have trivial bugs fixed, which then frees me to work on the next feature instead of tweaking a 95% done one.","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-20T02:04:45","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":10,"author":{"gitId":"andrewsoonqn"},"content":"","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-20T02:04:45","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":11,"author":{"gitId":"andrewsoonqn"},"content":"## JSON Data Loading and Storing","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-14T21:25:33","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":12,"author":{"gitId":"andrewsoonqn"},"content":"* Tool used: Cursor","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-14T21:25:33","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":13,"author":{"gitId":"andrewsoonqn"},"content":"* Observations:","lastModifiedDate":"2026-02-14T21:25:33","isFullCredit":false},{"lineNumber":14,"author":{"gitId":"andrewsoonqn"},"content":"  * Although I did not provide much context, the LLM was able to accurately follow Jackson\u0027s API and implement correctly.
