In previous commits, the Task class has been given a boolean attribute of \"isComplete\", used to indicate whether or not the task has been completed, and a bracket representation of whether it is complete. The Task class has been changed to add new methods to mark and unmark, by returning a new Task object with identical attributes except for either a true value of \"isComplete\" or false value of \"isComplete\", in a side-effect free manner: markAsComplete() and markAsIncomplete() respectively.\n\nKluso parses the user input, checks to see if it is of the form \"mark \u003cint\u003e\" or \"unmark \u003cint\u003e\" where \u003cint\u003e represents any integer, for the mark as complete and mark as incomplete commands respectively, checks if the integer is found as an index number in the list of tasks, and then calls markAsComplete() or markAsIncomplete() respectively on the Task instance in the tasks array which stores all tasks given so far. Kluso takes the new task and stores it in the array, replacing the old task in the same position.\n\nA point of future improvement is to maybe ensure that \"mark\" and \"unmark\" are only triggered as commands if an integer follows.\n\nThere are two commented-out pieces of test code that should not be included.\n","tags":["Level-3"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":66,"deletions":2}}}]}]},"authorFileTypeContributionMap":{"aqfw":{"java":194,"md":0,"fxml":0,"sh":0,"bat":0,"gradle":0,"txt":0}},"authorContributionVariance":{"aqfw":2180.0735},"authorDisplayNameMap":{"aqfw":"CS2103-F08-3 QUAK..ARON"}}
